    <h1>Add a book to the site</h1>
      <p>
      This search uses the
      <a href="https://www.openlibrary.org">Open Library</a> for results. There
      are a lot of books in the world, so the more specific you can make your
      search query the better your results will be. "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's
      Stone Rowling" is a better search than just "Harry Potter".
    </p>
    <p>
      This form submits your query to the
      <a href="https://openlibrary.org/developers/api">Open Library API</a> and,
      it will return a maximum of 10 results. Then you can then
      verify the single book you want to submit to the site, and write your review for it.
